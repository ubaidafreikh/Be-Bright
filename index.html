          We run exciting full-day and overnight indoor camps for young people during school holidays, 
          held at various locations across the UK. These camps are designed to equip youth with valuable 
          knowledge and life skills in a fun, engaging, and supportive environment that encourages independence 
          and teamwork. <br><br>
          Each camp centres around a unique Islamic theme, with activities and lessons 
          tailored to deepen participants’ understanding of that theme in a meaningful and memorable way.

      <p> 
      We are a father and son with different specialties and skills, but with one thing in common – 
      a passion for teaching and helping people achieve their academic goals, and years of experience doing just that.
       We strive to make all of our subjects as engaging and enjoyable as possible and wish to show you that even maths can be fun! 
       We aim to adapt and change our teaching to fit the needs of each individual; whether you have learning difficulties or special 
       requirements, we believe that you can still excel in all of your subjects. We wish to change everyone’s approach 
      and mindset towards learning, turning a negative fixed mindset to a positive growth mindset.
